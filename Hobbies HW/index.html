    <h2>Hello everybody!</h2>
     <p>I am an international student from Mexico, I´m a freshman and my major is Software Engineering.</p> 
        <p>I have been a Latter Saint for my whole life and I love to hear messages from President Monson, my favorite quote from him is ´Our task is to become our best selves. One of God’s greatest gifts to us is the joy of trying again, for no failure ever need be final.´</p>
        <p>My hobbies are latin dancing, watching romance movies, medical drama series and reading. I have a younger brother who also studies here and I joined a folkloric dance group with him. </p>
     <p>I really like getting to know how things work and making new things, that is why I chose to take this class and I hope I can be profficient in web design in the future.</p>
