    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Latin dancing</h2>
    <p>I learned how to dance when I was 14 at the FSYÂ´s I attended and I started to appreciate how free and happy I felt with the music and company, so now I love moving to the rythms of bachata, cumbia, merengue, and salsa.</p>
    <h2> Watching romance moviesand medical dramas</h2>
    <p> My favorite movie in the whole world is Pride and Prejudice but I really love movies that show how people choose each other against every trial.</p>
        <p> I think that is aprt of the reason of why I like medical dramas, because people fight to overcome problems and try with all their might and knowledge to save a life.</p>

    <h2>Reading</h2>
    <p> I love that I can see marvelous worlds with heroes and villians through the words of incredible authors.
        My favorite books are the ones from the Inkheart series, beacuse I feel like in a medieval fairy tale.
